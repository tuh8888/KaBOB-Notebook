### Human Disease Ontology <a name="human-disease-ontology" />
[DOID][DOID] [OWL][DOID-OWL] [DOC][DOID-DOC]
(Note: It seems that it may have been renamed to the Disease Ontology or else the human version is the canonical. I think DOID stands for Disease Ontology ID)

Serves as a way to connect biological data to other disease-related resources such as SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD-10, and MeSH.

Eight main nodes:
* Disease of cellular proliferation
* Disease of mental health
* Disease of anatomical Entity
* Disease by infectious agent
* Disease of metabolism
* Genetic disease
* Physical disorder
* Syndrome

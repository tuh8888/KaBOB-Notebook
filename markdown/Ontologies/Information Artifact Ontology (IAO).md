A representation for information content entities (ICEs) such as documents, data-bases, and digital images. One of its main goals is to classify "aboutness". It has to balance the fact that *specific* entities have generic dependence on *universal* entities. Aboutness is also referred to by the expressions "reference" and "denotation"

* INFORMATION CONTENT ENTITY =def. an ENTITY which is (1) GENERICALLY DEPENDENT on (2) some MATERIAL ENTITY and which (3) stands in a relation of ABOUTNESS to some ENTITY.

* INFORMATION QUALITY ENTITY (IQE) =def. a QUALITY that is the concretization of some INFORMATION CONTENT ENTITY (ICE) (Smith et al., 2013). IQEs are called "information carriers".

* ARTIFACT =def. a MATERIAL ENTITY created or modified or selected by some agent to realize a certain FUNCTION or ROLE (Examples: a key, a lock, a screwdriver) 

* INFORMATION ARTIFACT =def. an ARTIFACT whose function is to bear an INFORMATION QUALITY ENTITY. (Examples: a hard drive, a traffic sign, a printed form, a passport, a currency note, an RFID chip, a SIM card)

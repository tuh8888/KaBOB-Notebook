### Relation Ontology <a name="relation-ontology" />
[RO][RO] [OWL][RO-OWL] [DOC][RO-DOC]

A formalized and consistent vocabulary for describing the relations between terms to supplement other ontologies.

#### Types of relations
* (class, class): for example, the *is_a* relation obtaining between the class *SWR1 complex* and the class *chromatin remodeling complex*, or between the class *exocytosis* and the class *secretion*; 

* (instance, class): for example, the relation *instance_of* obtaining between this particular vesicle membrane and the class *vesicle membrane*, or between this particular instance of mitosis and the class *mitosis*; 

* (instance, instance): for example, the relation of instance-level parthood (called *part_of* in what follows), obtaining between this particular vesicle membrane and the endomembrane system in the corresponding cell, or between this particular M phase of some mitotic cell cycle and the entire cell cycle of the particular cell involved.

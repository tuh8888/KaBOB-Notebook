### Chemical Entities of Biological Interest <a name="chemical-entities-of-biological-interest" />
[ChEBI][ChEBI] [OWL][ChEBI-OWL] [DOC][ChEBI-DOC]

A dictionary for "small molecular entities", so it doesn't include proteins or nucleic acids. Also includes classes of molecular entities. The ChEBI ontology is a DAG, with children able to have multiple parents.

#### Subontologies
* Molecular structure, in which molecular entities or parts thereof are classified according to composition and structure, e.g. hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, tertiary amines;

* Role, divided into three sub-categories: 
    * 'chemical role' which classifies entities on the basis of their role within a chemical context, e.g. as ligand, inhibitor, surfactant; 
    * biological role which classifies entities on the basis of their role within a biological context, e.g. antibiotic, antiviral agent, coenzyme, hormone; 
    * 'application' which classifies on the basis of their intended use by humans, e.g. pesticide, antirheumatic drug, fuel;

* Subatomic Particle, which classifies particles which are smaller than atoms, e.g. electron, photon, nucleon.

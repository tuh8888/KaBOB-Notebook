### Protein-Protein Interaction Ontology <a name="protein-interaction-ontology" />
[MI][MI] [OWL][MI-OWL] [DOC][MI-DOC]

PSI-MI ontology is used to archive protein-protein interactions. Is used to represent binary or *n*-nary interactions as well as the experimental or biological role of the interactors, the experimental methods used to detect the interaction, the binding domain of the interactors, and the kinetics of the binding reaction. It also allows for annotations of genetic interactions and the experimental evidence of co-localization among molecules.

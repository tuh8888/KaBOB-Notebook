[HP][HP] [OWL][HP-OWL] [DOC][HP-DOC]

An ontology intended to describe all phenotype anomalies. Phenotypic abnormality is the main subontology of HP and contains descriptions of clinical abnormalities. Other subontologies describe inheritance patterns, onset/clinical course, and modifiers of abnormalities. Maps to nearly all of OMIM.

#### Subontologies:
* Phenotypic abnormality: This is the main ontology of the HPO and contains descriptions of clinical abnormalities. The level 1 children of this class are formed by terms such as Abnormality of the musculoskeletal system and Hematological abnormality.

* Clinical modifier: This ontology contains classes that describe typical modifiers of clinical symptoms. For example the speed of progression, the variablity or the onset. It contains terms such as Onset in childhood, Rapidly progressive, or Incomplete penetrance.

* Mortality/Aging: This sub-ontology describes Time of death and contains classes such as Neonatal death or Sudden death.

* Mode of inheritance: This relatively small ontology is intended to describe the mode of inheritance and contains terms such as Autosomal dominant..

* Frequency: Frequency with that patients do show a particular clinical feature. Examples are Obligate, Frequent, and Occasional. These terms are defined in the same way as Orphanet defines them.

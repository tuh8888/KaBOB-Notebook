### Mammalian Phenotype Ontology <a name="mammalian-phenotype-ontology" />
[MP][MP] [OWL][MP-OWL] [DOC][MP-DOC]
(Note: Not in current KaBOB)

An ontology originally with the goal of describing the phenotypes of mice and other model mammalian species. It allows for the description of the various mutant mouse phenotypes that have been engineered in labs. The Mouse Genome Informatics Database ([MGI][http://www.informatics.jax.org/]) is one of the primary users of this onotlogy.

One of the goals of MP is to facilitate cross-species comparisons.

If an author states that a particular mouse genotype is a model of human disease or syndrome, an association with an Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) human disease term is made

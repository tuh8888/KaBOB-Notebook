### Basic Formal Ontology <a name="basic-formal-ontology" />
[BFO][BFO] [OWL][BFO-OWL] [DOC][BFO-DOC]

A domain agnostic approach to help construct ontologies. This is used as the scaffold in KaBOB. All of the other ontologies should branch from classes in this one.

* Determinates:  typically associated with the possibility of continuous variation along a scale to which real-number measurement values can be assigned.
    * Examples are: 37.0Â°C temperature, 1.6 meter length, 4 kg weight
    * with determinables: temperature, length, mass

* Continuant: Can only be sliced along the spatial dimension. Can be *things* or *entities that are dependent on things*. "A *continuant* is an entity that persists, endures, or continues to exist through time while maintaining its identity" [DOC][BFO-DOC]
    * Example: Harrison

* Occurrant: Can be sliced along spatial or temporal dimensions. Events. "An occurrent is an entity that unfolds itself in time or it is the instantaneous boundary of such an entity (for example a beginning or an ending) or it is a temporal or spatiotemporal region which such an entity occupies_temporal_region or occupies_spatiotemporal_region" [DOC][BFO-DOC]
    * Example: Harrison's childhood

(Note: perhaps this replaces the Brenda Tissue Ontology?)

"An intetgrative cross-species ontology". Used to integrate anatomical components of different species. It is intended to help make inferences about maladies, biological processes, etc. about a species by using information about another. Uses the high-level categories in the Common Anatomy Refernce Ontology (CARO).
